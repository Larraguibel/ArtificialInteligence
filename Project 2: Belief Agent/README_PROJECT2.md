# Introduction
 
This is a Python implementation of a belief base, which supports the basic operations of expansion, contraction and revision. There are 3 archives:
 
* *Belief_Agent.py*: here we find the class BeliefBase, which allows us to create an manipulate a belief base, as explained in the report. There is a main that will allow you to run a small implementation of revision and contraction.
 
* *AGM_postulates_Test.py*: functions implementing the AGM postulates to test over the contraction and revision operations in the belief base. There is a main that allow you to easily test the implementation of the AGM postulates over  
 
* *func.py*: Auxiliar functions for the BeliefBase class implementation and 3 contraction AGM postulates for functioning guarantee.
